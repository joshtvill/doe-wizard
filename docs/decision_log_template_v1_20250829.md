Version: v1 (2025-08-29)

| Date (UTC) | Area | Decision | Rationale | Affects | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| YYYY-MM-DD | Schema/UI/Algo/Infra | Short decision title | Why we chose this now | Files/Screens | JV | Effective |

Rules:
- One row per decision. Never edit history; append a new row if you change course.
- Reference PR/commit where possible.

| 2025-08-29 | Schema/UI | Adopt v1 schemas + UI baseline + autosave-on-Next | Freeze churn; artifacts become the contract enabling vertical slices and green gates. | All screens; services/artifacts; ui/blocks | JV | Effective |

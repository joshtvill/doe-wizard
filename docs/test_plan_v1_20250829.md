# Test Plan — DOE Wizard MVP
Version: v1 (2025-08-29)

## Levels
1) **Unit** (utils/services): deterministic functions; 80%+ coverage for core logic.
2) **Golden** (artifacts): compare bytes of JSON/CSV from tiny fixtures.
3) **E2E Smoke**: scripted run S1→S6 on fixtures; assert artifacts exist & basic invariants.
4) **Performance**: timing asserts vs budgets; warn (don’t fail) on exceed.

## Fixtures (tiny)
- features_small.csv (10×6), response_small.csv (10×3) with join key `run_id`.
- collapsed_small.csv (expected), proposals_small.csv (non-empty).

## Golden Artifacts (expected shape)
- session_setup.json, profile.json, datacard.json, model_compare.csv, champion_bundle.json,
  optimization_settings.json, proposals.csv, optimization_trace.json, handoff_summary.md.

## CLI Smoke (PowerShell)
- S2: join+profile → writes profile.json; prints join stats.
- S3: roles+collapse → writes modeling_ready.csv, datacard.json; prints variance summary.
- S4: modeling → writes model_compare.csv, champion_bundle.json; prints champion rationale.
- S5: optimization → writes proposals.csv; prints top-5 rows.

## Acceptance Gates
- Each screen’s “Next” enabled only after its tests pass on fixtures.

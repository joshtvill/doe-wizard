UTILS :: paths.py
Version: v1 (2025-08-29)

Purpose
-------
Pure helpers: typing, logging, naming, safe I/O, math/stats. No Streamlit imports here.

Contracts (no code)
-------------------
- Provide stable imports and side‑effect‑free helpers.
- Never access Streamlit session_state here.
- Keep numerical utilities deterministic for testability.

Notes
-----
- Placeholder scaffold. Implement functions per SYSTEM_DESIGN and orchestration map.
- Add unit tests before wiring into Streamlit screens.

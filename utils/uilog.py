"""
UI/logging helpers for append-only JSONL event logs.

Primary API (used by screens):
    write_event_jsonl(path: str, event: dict) -> None

Design:
- Append one JSON object per line (JSONL).
- Create parent directories as needed.
- Be resilient to transient Windows file-lock behavior (retry loop).
- Never raise on logging failures in production paths.

    Guarantees:

        - Never raises exceptions to the caller (best-effort logging).
